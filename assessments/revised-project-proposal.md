The project will involve a hands-on application of the techniques and tools that we discuss in class, and can be completed either individually or in a group of at most three. You can read more about the overall goals and structure for the project on the [project writeup]({{site.baseurl}}/assessments/project).

Using the feedback provided by the course staff on your preliminary proposal and informed by the project discussions that we have in class, revise your project proposal. You may make any revisions that you feel are necessary, up to an extreme of working on a totally different project (perhaps even in a different team). At the other extreme: if there are no changes whatsoever, then include a note stating so. The format for the revised project proposal is identical to the preliminary one.

The project proposal should explain, at a high level, the project that you have in mind. The proposal should address the following points:
1. Describe the goals of your project: are you seeking to develop new functionality for an existing application, develop a greenfield application, or evaluate some existing system?
2. What will be the concrete deliverables that you create?
3. If there will be an evaluation aspect, what metrics will you capture? 
4. What technologies will you use?
5. What are the major risks that you see in the project that you are proposing? Do you have contingency plans in case some key aspect of the project doesn't work out?

The proposal should be roughly one page long, although if you find it useful to include figures, or additional text, that is OK, too.

The revised project proposal is due on Mar 2 at 11:00am, submitted via Canvas.

A good-faith, on-time attempt to answer the questions above is necessary to receive a "check" on the project overall (the grading for the preliminary proposal is binary: either you have done it or you haven't).
