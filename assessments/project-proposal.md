The project will involve a hands-on application of the techniques and tools that we discuss in class, and can be completed either individually or in a group of at most three.  You can read more about the overall goals and structure for the project on the [project writeup]({{site.baseurl}}/assessments/project).

Before the preliminary project proposal is due, we will dedicate an entire class meeting to brainstorming and discussing potential project topics. On the day that the preliminary proposal is due, we will have another discussion section in class to help refine project concepts, and then you will submit a revised project proposal. This should provide ample opportunities to resolve any concerns regarding project scope, feasibiltiy, and organization before the implementation phase beings.

The project proposal should explain, at a high level, the project that you have in mind. The proposal should address the following points:
1. Describe the goals of your project: are you seeking to develop new functionality for an existing application, develop a greenfield application, or evaluate some existing system?
2. What will be the concrete deliverables that you create?
3. If there will be an evaluation aspect, what metrics will you capture? 
4. What technologies will you use?
5. What are the major risks that you see in the project that you are proposing? Do you have contingency plans in case some key aspect of the project doesn't work out?

The proposal should be roughly one page long, although if you find it useful to include figures, or additional text, that is OK, too.

The preliminary project proposal is due on February 23rd at 11:59pm, submitted via Canvas. If you are working in a group, please be sure to tag each of your team members on Canvas.

A good-faith, on-time attempt to answer the questions above is necessary to receive a "check" on the project overall (the grading for the preliminary proposal is binary: either you have done it or you haven't).
